# Flow-Automate

To use definition.json in flow, create a new flow and open it in Power Automate Tools: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/power-automate-tools/jccblbmcghkddifenlocnjfmeemjeacc. Copy and paste the content of definition.json onto the opened window. Save the changes and run the flow as usual. 

The Excel file linked in definition.json is located in SharePoint Site - CMSE-Committees/Documents/CMSETech. I have yet to figure out a way to directly link the JSON file to this repo. This will be the next step in this project.
